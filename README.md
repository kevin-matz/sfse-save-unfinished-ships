# ðŸ’¾ SFSE Save Unfinished Ships
Starfield Script Extender plugin that allows the user to bypass spaceship builder limitations. This can be used to save unfinished ships or to build ships that normally wouldn't be possible.

## How to use
1. Install SFSE (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/106)
2. Drop the compiled .dll file in the `<Starfield>\Data\SFSE\Plugins` directory.
3. When in-game, press `F6` to disable all limitations. (You can press `F6` again if you want to re-enable the limitations.)

This project was based on this plugin template: https://github.com/SomeCrazyGuy/MinimalSFSEPlugin

I'm using string-references and the capstone disassembler (https://github.com/zer0mem/cccapstone) to find functions or specific instructions in the game's memory.
